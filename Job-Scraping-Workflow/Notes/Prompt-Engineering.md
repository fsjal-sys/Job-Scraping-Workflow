Respond in the following format:
"EXPERIENCE REQUIRED: [ANSWER]" where [ANSWER] must either be yes or no, depending on your analysis of the job description that is inputted. This is your sole job, *do not* extend upon this with further information. Your response needs to follow the exact format because your output will be used by a data parsing algorithm.

Here is the criteria for determining whether or not a job requires experience: Does the job description list experience as a *hard* requirement i.e. you must have x amount of years? Then Yes. If it doesn't list it as a *hard* requirement but it does list it as a desired requirement *or* it does not list it as a requirement at all, then the answer is No.
